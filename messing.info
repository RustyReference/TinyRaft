Information on this branch.

Currently messing around with servers mainly.
I am putting all clients connected to the leader in a linked list.
Then all backup-servers in another list.

Then simply as data comes from client I will write to a db and forward it to each backup server. 

Once that whole thing is working I really need to add an encryption and password system.
If non-authorized people can connect and write to the db it is pretty bad so password is required. 

Encryption is gonna be based on the password and for tools like wireshark mainly.
