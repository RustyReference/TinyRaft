# TinyRaft
This project is currently in progress.
- An implementation of the Raft Consensus Algorithm written purely in C11.

# Building
- Be sure to run "make clean" first before running "make". "make" will compile with debugger flags, include all warnings, and use Address Sanitizer to maximize safety.

# Contributing
Folders:  
src - source code.  
docs - documentation for the code and detailed usage.
